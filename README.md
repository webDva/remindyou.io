This extremely short-lived project was an attempt in building a web-based to-do list service. It also had the caveat of not relying on a front-end user interface framework such as Angular as I wanted to shun complexity with this endeavor.

The progress made in this project involves just being able to create a user account in a database through the browser. Still, I've gained experience in communicating with a server using XMLHttpRequest and in DOM-Javascript interaction.
